# Raytracing Resourcepack

To see the shader, equip the resourcepack, load into a world, and summon an item display with blackstone.

```mcfunction
summon item_display ~ ~ ~ {item:{id:"minecraft:blackstone",count:1}}
```

The position of the item display will be the origin of the scene.

The demo scene consists of a (mathematically inaccurate) black hole.
